# Welcome

# New Neighbour? Welcome to
Castle Court

**Introduction**

Hello.The purpose of this document, in addition to welcoming you to
Castle Court is to make you aware of some useful information and
contacts. You have joined a small group of 21 flats set in this
beautiful conservation zone at the top of the town. Standing in our own
private grounds as we do makes for a close knit and friendly set of
neighbours, but also carries individual responsibility to look after our
environment.

**Useful Information.**

**Grounds** All grounds within the perimeter walls are
under common ownership. They are private property for the use of
residents. Feel free to use benches, BBQ’s, and kid’s play equipment.
Some residents have started an allotment.You can find out more on our
**Facebook** page.

A volunteer committee of Castle Court owners oversees general
maintenance of the grounds and driveway, although it’s up to every
resident to contribute to keeping the place clean and tidy.

**Parking.** Basic common sense must apply here. Don’t
park in front of a garage door that isn’t yours and don’t block driveway
access for the delivery vans and cleansing vehicles which must use it.
Otherwise, you can find a spot and use it!

**Bins** are collected on Wednesdays. For details, check
Stirling Council’s website at [https://www.stirling.gov.uk/bins-waste-recycling/](https://www.stirling.gov.uk/bins-waste-recycling/)

There is also a community compost pile for your veggie waste behind
the greenhouse. Boxes for glass are found at the driveway entrance.

Please note: **Green bin = Cardboard**

**Grey bin = General waste**

**Blue bin = Plastics and cans**

**Brown bin = food waste**

**Boxes at driveway entrance = glass**

Put only the correct waste in the green,blue and brown recycling bins
otherwise the binmen will not uplift it.

**Facebook groups** Our main means of communication with
each other, apart from saying Hi! is through two private groups on
Facebook. These are

**Castle Court Residents Group** Which is open to all
owners and residents. Also the most fun. Used for general information:
if you’re looking for something, have something to announce, notice
something unusual etc.

**Castle Court Owners Association** is specifically for
Owners. It’s for communication on matters concerning the management and
maintenance of the common areas within our perimeter walls (and how to
pay for them). The common areas include gardens and driveways.

Further information such as our association’s Constitution and
Minutes of meetings can be found in the ‘Files’ section of the Group’s
page.

**To Join** either or both of these groups, please
contact the System Administrator by searching on Facebook for
’**Castle Court Residents Group’** , clicking join and then
giving your flat number. The administrator will do the rest.
Alternatively you can ask a neighbour for help, we’re all members.

**Welcome to Castle Court**

**Supplementary information for Owners**

**Welcome** to Castle Court. Whether you intend to be a
resident or to let your flat, this page contains information which will
be of interest to you

**Common Good fund**

A **mandatory payment**, currently of **£10 per
month** per flat is payable into our Common Good Fund. 100% of
money gathered is returned to the community through joint projects such
as grass cutting. The best way to make payments is to set up a standing
order to Bank of Scotland:

**Acc No 19547169**

**Sort 80-22-60**

**Reference = Your flat number**

**Owners and Residents Association**

Castle court is in a fairly unique position in that we don’t
currently have a factor or property agent to look after maintenance (and
take commissions) Instead we have an Owners and Residents association
with a committee, elected on an annual basis with the following
objectives:

- To promote and protect the interests of all owners at Castle Court
on matters concerning the management and maintenance of the area within
its perimeter walls including buildings, gardens and driveway.
- To ensure that everyone resident within the building, including
owners and tenants, has an opportunity to become involved in the
Association and its work
- To promote a positive community spirit within Castle Court.
- To establish Maintenance Accounts for the back and front courts to
hold monies in advance of communal repairs for each court and to make
regulations governing expenditure from those accounts.
- To establish a Common Good Fund to hold monies for future major
repairs, improvements and grounds maintenance as shared by all residents
& owners and to make regulations governing expenditure from that
account.

The association holds an AGM each May. You will be invited to
participate. It’s also a good way to meet the neighbours.

Useful information on the Residents Association, documents including
this document and the Associations Constitution can be found in the
‘Files’ section of the Owners Facebook page
